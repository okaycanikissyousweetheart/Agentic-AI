# What is Agentic AI? — With a Dynamic Dashboard Example

An **agentic AI** is an artificial intelligence system designed to act autonomously toward goals by making decisions, using tools, and adapting to changes. Unlike passive AI (like chatbots that only respond to prompts), agentic AI proactively plans, executes, and iterates.

## Concrete Example: Dynamic BI Dashboard Agent

**User Query:**  
*"Show me sales performance in Europe last quarter, broken down by product category, and highlight areas needing improvement. Also, compare it to the same quarter last year and suggest actions to boost sales."*

### How the Agentic AI Works

1. **Query Understanding & Decomposition**
   - Parses the question for: metrics (sales), dimensions (region, product), comparisons (YoY), and intent (recommendations).
2. **Data Source Integration**
   - Connects to sales, CRM, and marketing data sources (e.g., Snowflake, Salesforce).
3. **Data Retrieval & Processing**
   - Fetches and compares sales data, identifies weak categories, and aggregates KPIs.
4. **Dashboard Generation**
   - Creates interactive charts:
     - Sales by category with highlights for declines/improvements.
     - Year-on-year comparisons.
     - Maps and tables for drill-downs.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Generates natural-language insights and actionable recommendations (e.g., “Promote electronics in Germany”).
6. **KPI Tracking**
   - Summarizes key performance indicators at the top.
7. **Dynamic Interaction**
   - User can drill down or ask follow-up questions. The agent fetches more data or generates new visuals as needed.

## Key Features of an Agentic BI System

- **Natural language interface** — Ask questions in plain English.
- **Multi-source data fusion** — Combine sales, marketing, CRM, and external data.
- **Proactive analysis** — Detects issues and explains why.
- **Action-oriented** — Recommends next steps, not just shows data.
- **Self-optimizing** — Learns from user feedback.

> 💡 **Static vs. Agentic Dashboards:**  
> - *Static*: Pre-built, fixed charts (e.g., “Q3 Sales”).  
> - *Agentic*: Generates new charts and insights on demand, for any question—like having a data analyst on call.

### Real-World Tools Enabling This

- **LLMs**: For understanding queries and generating insights (e.g., GPT-4).
- **BI platforms**: Tableau, Power BI, or custom dashboards (e.g., Plotly/Dash).
- **Agent frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex for chaining reasoning steps.
- **Data orchestration**: Airflow, Prefect for pipeline management.
