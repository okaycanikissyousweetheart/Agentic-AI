## Is AnalyticsAI Connected to LLMs like OpenAI or Gemini?

**Short answer:**  
Yes, AnalyticsAI is designed to connect to leading large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Gemini (Google), and others.

**How does this work?**

- In the backend scaffold, you’ll see dependencies like `openai` and `langchain` in `requirements.txt`.
- These libraries let AnalyticsAI send natural language user queries to LLMs, receive back structured insights, recommendations, and data queries.
- The architecture is modular: you can swap in different LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.) depending on your API keys and needs.

**What does the LLM do?**

- Understands user requests (e.g., “Show me sales breakdown in Europe last quarter”).
- Decomposes complex questions into actionable steps for the agent.
- Generates natural language insights and recommendations for dashboard narratives.
- Helps automate reasoning, error correction, and tool usage.

**How do I configure which LLM to use?**

- In a production setup, you provide your API keys for OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc. via environment variables or config files.
- The codebase can be extended to support multiple LLMs or use the one you prefer.
