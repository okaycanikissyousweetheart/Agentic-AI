# AnalyticsAI – Architecture Overview

## 1. Overview

AnalyticsAI is a fully agentic analytics platform for enterprises – every user has an AI copilot that:
- Connects to all business data sources
- Answers natural language queries
- Generates dashboards, narratives, and action recommendations
- Enforces guardrails (compliance, PII masking, etc.)
- Automates follow-on actions (email, CRM update, alerts)

## 2. Core Components

- **Backend:** FastAPI, LangChain agent orchestration, DuckDB for file analytics
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript, dynamic dashboard rendering, chat-based UX
- **Data Layer:** Universal adapters for SQL, APIs, files
- **Guardrails:** Pluggable rules engine (Python, no-code UI)
- **Action Execution:** Integrations with email, Slack, Salesforce, etc.
- **Infra:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform

## 3. Microservices

- `cortex_engine`: Agentic business reasoning
- `data_fusion`: Real-time data harmonization
- `market_intelligence_hub`: External signal ingestion
- `learning_core`: Self-optimizing feedback loop

## 4. Security & Compliance

- Role-based access, row-level security
- Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Automated audit trails

## 5. Roadmap

- MVP: NLQ → insights + dashboards
- V2: Automated actions, proactive recommendations
- V3: Self-improving agents, industry-specific templates
